### Hey 👋, I'm Marco (@cylammarco)

I'm a senior researcher/software developer at The University of Edinburgh, working with the Euclid consortium. My researches cover the topic of white dwarfs⭐, faint blue pulsators🌟, star formation history of the Galaxy🌌, and spectral data reduction software development 🏳️‍🌈👾.
